We should also look at amalgamation of fire and BC Ambulance services, to many redundancies. The cost of a fire person vs an Ambulance attendant are grossly different. Put them in to the same place and figure out a costing mechanism between the Prov Gov't (BC Ambulance) and municipal gov't (PG Fire). I know this is more then perhaps PG City can do, but somebody needs to start the conversation.  

Please run the city like you would your own household. If you don't have the money, don't spend it. Save money for nice to have items and spend money on what is necessary.

Add to that the city should actively recruit up to 6 more officers and have at least car 60 manned round the clock by one or two vehicles as it has been proven it’s needed.

Secondly focus on repairing and replacing water, sewer and drainage lines in a proactive manner rather than reactively it’s well known that water, sewer and drainage systems are dated and failing more often and requiring more attention that is taking away from other projects.

Thirdly the lack of movement on the homeless and street walkers throughout the bowl. I have been personally attacked numerous times by homeless fortunately never injured but it is a very big reason why I will not go anywhere downtown and I often recommend others to go elsewhere because nobody is making any attempts to deal with the homelessness issue. Unfortunately it seems the only way it will be dealt with is when a member of the general public is seriously injured or killed by homeless people and then it will be too late.

Fourth bylaw is still seen as a massive joke by the citizens of PG as bylaw spends so much time downtown they ignore the rest of the city. The city really needs to step up and show that bylaw does more than looking for vehicles downtown to ticket. While I do understand bylaw does more than that this is all the citizens of the city sees and we all know the city has been lousy with Public Relations.

Transparency as there has been a decidedly lack of transparency by the city over the past several years and there is a definite lack of caring by the city.

I don't want people starting fires under my deck or breaking into my unit. I don't want to see condoms, needles, vomit, and garbage in my yard from people who were there in the middle of the night. I don't want my dog barking two or three nights of the week cuz someone is outside my door doing a creepy thing (like smoking crack or stealing extension cords). I feel for all of these people but it isn't a municipal tax that should be paying to repair all this -- but the other levels of government aren't doing enough so? As an elderly citizen who lives alone I don't feel safe. I have taken all the precautions we're told to take (extra locks and chains; more lighting; signs that say private property; pit bull dog; gates around my front door area; metal fencing over all my windows; chains and locks on everything from a bird feeder to a plastic plant box; every year more and different and higher fencing which has cost us a lot of money...) It is not just my own paranoia either. My unit has been broken into. In the almost two decades I've been here there have been three fires set in our yard. One was quite huge and could have ended up killing someone. Why can't the city put better lighting in these alleys? I know that more housing and mental health programs have been created and I totally applaud that. Shelters, treatment programs, social workers.. I really value all of that. Yet meanwhile: I am a hostage in my own home after dark.  At the same time the fact is there are still people in the ally all the time  (the alley between 7/11 and Value Village). We've had cars broken into repeatedly; our sheds broken into and a kyak was stolen; bikes stolen; tools from our sheds or cars. Complaining does no good ether because these thefts were always under $5,000. Could you at least keep the ""prolific offenders"" under safer supervision for longer? One of the fire starters - I repeatedly saw her and spoke to her - but nothing is possible on my end. She just returned. I've asked some of the women why they don't use a safe injection site or stay at the shelters. One told me if she goes to a safe injection site someone else might take her drugs. She feels safer in our yard. Other women have told us they feel better changing their clothes in our yard or even washing with our garden hose in the summer cuz the shelters don't feel safe to them. I have always voted in every potential election. I am a committed citizen and do volunteer work etc. I recognize this is a huge complex problem and I'm told that every time I complain. All the threads and shards of this go from heaven to hell and tangle upon themselves. Bottom line: I have the intrinsic sovereign right to take my garbage out to our locked bin after dusk. I have the right to not feel impelled to walk around our yard every single day and ""inspect"" for needles, garbage, broken locks, etc. This doesn't mean that I am without compassion. I have compassion for myself and the other single women in the neighborhood. It is a municipal responsibility to provide effective lighting in the downtown. It is a municipal responsibility to insure my neighbors who run skanky rentals are forced to clean their yards, lock their garbage bins; insure their fences aren't falling down; clean up graffiti. Again we've complained about these things over the last 16 or so years and the same graffiti is still there; the same unlocked bins that end up with filth all over that then blows into our yard. I wonder if there were all of these things happening in a wealthier area of town - would the complaints remain unresponded  to or ineffectually responded to?",,,,,,,,,,Bylaw Enforcement Services: 10% Increase (52.79147298),,Police Services: 10% Increase (673.9213912),,,,,,,,89,,72,,

Improving livability for the general population requires increasing public transit (more convenient routes, more bus stops instead of dispersed stops, higher frequency of buses- need to consider how to improve transit system so people use the bus more and increased usership will in turn support more revenue and support for a transit system), more active transportation infrastructure (walking and biking lanes to go from neighbourhood to neighbourhood with more convenience), more community recreation opportunities that are affordable, and community events that foster social connection and wellbeing. 

For marginalized populations (such as people who are unsheltered and homeless), it is pivotal that the City works with stakeholders to get people sheltered and connected to the resources they need. This requires financial and human resources from the City.  

As the City establishes its 2023 budget, as a citizen, it would be valuable to see the City look at inefficiencies and reduce those. I think it is interesting to see that climate change mitigation and adaptation is not a service area. Given the present and future challenges that will be posed by climate change, I think it necessary for the City to consider dedicating budget to climate change mitigation and adaptation, whether it is a separate service area or part of another service area.",Corporate Services: 15% Decrease (336.7888809),Community Planning and Infrastructure: Keep the Same (139.66),Services that attract and retain business and facilitate development: Keep the Same (6.46),Community Support services : 10% Increase (128.7968413),"Parks, Trails, and Beautification: 5% Increase (101.1801663)",Recreation and Community Services: 5% Increase (180.5907037), Public Transit Services: 10% Increase (93.48076694),Roads and Sidewalks: Keep the Same (112.22),Snow and Ice Control: 5% Decrease (189.0720114),Bylaw Enforcement Services: 5% Decrease (45.59263576),Fire Protection Services: Keep the Same (381.15), 5% Decrease (582.0230197),9,56,90,59,60,90,94,47,59,29,89,1

For instance, policing is a very important issue to my family, but we would like to see policing services cut back substantially. Adding policing and surveillance downtown will not solve the issue of unhoused people. We need community supports. Please seriously consider repealing the ""safe streets"" bylaw (or, put out a survey that explicitly asks about this bylaw, and transparently share the results with your constituents). It seemed obvious throughout the municipal debates that PG citizens are unhappy with the ""safe streets"" bylaw.

I'm worried that if we give less to the the police we may have more crime and possible vigilantism but I think it's due to the mental health and homeless situation that we need to petition to at the federal level. The cops do their job but the courts let them go... All the cities are handling this epidemic and we need solutions from our provincial or federal government. We can't do this alone. Let's petition for some action. I fear if we continue trying without a solid plan we will see more constables like Shaelynn die in the line of duty and citizens getting so fed up that they will try to solve the problem their way.

Much of the crime in the area is associated with addiction, mental health issues, and homelessness. Affordable housing or incarceration of this population will go a long to cleaning up the city. The 1st Avenue development is a start but more is needed, perhaps public/private partnerships would be one way to go. Enabling those with mental health and addictions is problematic, just pushing the problem into the future. Strict policies for continued support to those taking advantage of supportive housing is necessary. Custodial or semi-custodial housing with support services and strict rules to help those in need return to being a productive member of society is important. The D.A.R.T. Program is a good example of something that works. The city or regional district could have a similar program funded through provincial/federal grants to employ those getting their life back together; combined with supportive housing it could help clean up those living rough and lower the crime in the city, allowing emergency services to shift resources to other priorities.",Corporate Services: 5% Decrease (376.4111022),Community Planning and Infrastructure: Keep the Same (139.66),Services that attract and retain business and facilitate development: 5% Increase (7),Community Support services : 5% Increase (122.9424394),,, Public Transit Services: Keep the Same (84.98),Roads and Sidewalks: Keep the Same (112.22),Snow and Ice Control: Keep the Same (199.02),Bylaw Enforcement Services: 5% Increase (50.39186057),, 5% Decrease (582.0230197),53,,59,,,55,59,,,59,,

I live in lower college heights and the creekside development and the new builds behind me have impacted our water pressure. 

Increasing police and fire services are not working. These resources are being eaten up by the activities of the drug trade including our homeless population. If we can address the issues around the homeless then maybe the police and firefighters can resume what they were hired to do. I don’t think raising the funding for either police or firefighters is an answer. 

Bylaw services seem to be reluctant to enforce bylaws and concentrate their efforts on removing possessions of the homeless. Once they lose everything that they had previously stole what do you think they do?  Steal it all back again. Stop it’s not working!!

The sidewalks around the city are incredibly rough and very difficult to push a wheelchair on. I would like to see better accessibility for this. 

I am reluctant to go downtown because of the panhandling and the potential threat to my safety. I might be overreacting but the amount of garbage and human waste that is prevelant makes me stay away.
